# County-Specific Wildfire Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Southern California Case Study
Wildfires present a growing threat to public safety, environmental sustainability, and economic stability in California, with climate change threatening to amplify these risks. Accurate prediction of wildfire occurrences is essential for effective management and mitigation strategies. This project evaluates the performance of various machine learning models, including Random Forests, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), in predicting wildfire occurrences in Southern California's most vulnerable counties: Los Angeles and Riverside. The study utilized a comprehensive dataset from 2016 to 2020, including meteorological variables, vegetation indices, and fire occurrence records. The findings indicated that the Random Forest model outperformed other models, achieving the highest accuracy and F1 scores in both counties, thus providing the most reliable predictions of wildfire occurrences. Key variables such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and average temperature were identified as the most significant predictors of wildfire risk, highlighting the importance of vegetation density and climatic conditions in wildfire occurrence. The results emphasize the need for localized, county-specific models to capture the nuanced factors influencing wildfire risk. The study concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for improving wildfire risk assessment tools, proposing that more accurate and region-specific models can aid in developing targeted and effective wildfire management strategies in Southern California. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve wildfire prediction models and offers valuable insights for policymakers, fire response teams, and environmental scientists.
